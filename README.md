# AI-Powered Attendance Management System Using Facial Recognition

This is my graduation project, an AI-powered system for managing attendance using facial recognition technology.  
The system automatically detects and records student attendance by recognizing faces through a camera feed.

## Features
- Real-time facial recognition using deep learning models.
- Automatic attendance recording and report generation.
- Secure data storage with encryption.
- High accuracy even in different lighting conditions.
- User-friendly interface for administrators and teachers.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- SQLite / MySQL
- Tkinter / Web Interface

## Demo Video

## How It Works
1. The system captures a live video stream.
2. Detects faces in real time.
3. Matches the faces with the database.
4. Records attendance automatically.
